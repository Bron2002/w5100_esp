        help
            GPIO that is connected to W5100's /RESET pin.

        bool "MCU must drive SPI_EN pin"
        default false
        help
            Enable this in case the ESP32 must drive W5100's SPI_EN pin.
            Needed if the W5100 shares the SPI bus with another device.

    config W5100_SPI_EN_GPIO
        depends on W5100_SPI_EN_MANUAL
        int "SPI_EN pin's GPIO number"

    config W5100_SPI_CLCK
        int "SPI clock speed (hz)"

        help
            Clock speed to be used to communicate with the chip.

    config EMAC_RECV_TASK_ENABLE_CORE_AFFINITY
        bool "Enable W5100 recv task core selection"
        default false
        help
            Enable this to manually set W5100 core affinity. May be needed
            in order to balance loading across cores depending on workload.
            Leave it disabled for no affinity.

    config EMAC_RECV_TASK_CORE
        depends on EMAC_RECV_TASK_ENABLE_CORE_AFFINITY
        int "Which core?"
        range 0 1

        help
            Select the core to pin the task to
            0 - PRO CPU
            1 - APP CPU

    config EMAC_RECV_TASK_ENABLE_DELAY
        bool "Enable RX task delay"
        default true
        help
            Enable the use of a delay at the end of the recv task to prevent
            it from monopolizing SPI. May be needed when there are other
            peripherals on the same SPI bus, especially if they're
            time-sensitive.

    config EMAC_DELAY_TICKS
        depends on EMAC_ENABLE_RECV_TASK_DELAY
        int "Number of ticks to delay"
        default 1

        bool "Enable bus acquiring"
        default false
        help
            This allows the SPI driver to assume all transactions will be directed to
            the same device, optimizing back to back transactions. Only enable it if
            W5100 is the only device in the SPI bus.

    config W5100_CS
        int "W5100 CS GPIO"
        default 17
        help
            GPIO connected to W5100's Slave Select line

    config W5100_SPI_LOCK
        bool "Enable driver locks"
        default false
        help
            Enable/disable locks around each SPI transaction.
            Only disable it if you serialize all accesses to the device.

    config W5100_SPI_BUS
        int "SPI bus"
        default 3
        help
            SPI bus to be used.
            1 = SPI_HOST
            2 = HSPI_HOST
            3 = VSPI_HOST
            Only select 1 if you know what you're doing. Check SPI Master documentation
            for more info.
